Latex Template Version 5

Guideline How to Setup the Latex Files
======================================
To use the J.UCS LaTeX template it is necessary to download both the template and the LaTeX style document (jucs2e.sty). 
The template file will load the style document which contains all instructions regarding layout and style. The style will 
be loaded automatically (package is included in the template) as long as both files are located in the same directory.

In case you use Texmaker or the like, make sure that you configure or select LuaLaTex for fast compiling. In case you use as 
underlaying tool Miktex, make sure you run the console and update all packages, and enable automatic downloading of missing 
packages, see also for details https://miktex.org/howto/miktex-console.
